# JavaScript

### To create any website you will need to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order  to create it in a perfect way .

1. HTML : gives the page structure and adds semantics.
2. CSS : style the page (color, borders, fonts ...etc)
3. JavaScript : add functionality to the site, changes how the site behave . 

### JavaScript file has .js extension, we can add javascript inside html in two ways using < script> tags ;
1. we can write the code after the script tag 
2. we can write the code in a .js file and put it as a src < script scr="the .js location'> 

### JavaScript data types :
1. String 'text, number, anything'  we can use + to concatenate strings 
2. Boolean (True , False)
3. Numbers (1.2 , 0 ,10) we can use + - * % / just like math 

Some JavaScript code examples : 
1. console.log('we can write anything') this will appear on console 
2. prompt('    ') to get input from the user 
3. alert(.hello.) this will appear when you open the site 
4. // hello there we cant run comments its just for inforamtion 

### There is something called variables in JavaScript we add them and give them a value or we can let the user give them a value .
example :

Var variable-name = variable-value

The variable could be any data type , but there are some rules for naming variables for example : 
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_)
2. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words like (var)
3. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores
