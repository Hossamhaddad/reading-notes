# Computers
## We have computers everywhere, theyr're in our pockets and cars or on our wrists (smart watch) or laptops .


## The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal! with mechanical levers and gears, by the 20th century computers started using electrical components . 
## Now we can use computers to talk to each other, play games :) control robots and a lot of other things .

## What makes a computer a computer : 
1. Input : tell the computer what to do you can use keyboard, mouse or a touch screen to give the computer information which is then stored in memory .
2. Storage : takes the information and gives it to the processor, and we the information is processed it stored back in the memory .
3. Processing : takes information from memory, it minipulates it or changes it using algorithm(series of commands), then send the procssed information back to the memory to be stored . 
4. Output : could be text , photo video and VR or games, it could be a signal to control a robot . 

### When computers connect over the internet the output from one copmuter becomes the input to another . 


## Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer by using bit (on-off.true-false.1-0)

## Computer use binary system (0-1), for example th number 9 in binary is 1001, we can represent any number with only one and zero, with 32 wires we can store all the way from 0 to 4 billion, we also can represent sound, image and text using 0 and 1 . 

## Every input or output of a computer is effectively a type of information which can be represented by on or off electrical signals . 
## Modren circuits can perform billions of calculation per second :
## Circuits type examples :
1. NOT
2. AND
3. OR
4. NOR

## We give the computer information by mouse keyboard or mic (input devices), input devices convert the information into binary information, there's a CPU where all the calculations are done, there's output devices that take information and convert into a physicla output .

## When you look inside a computer device you see bunch of circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs and all sort of other stuff this is the hardware, we dont see the software, software can be anything from apps anbd games to webpages .

## Programming languages let you type in commands in something that looks a lot like English, to draw a rectangle on the screen you just need a simple command that converted into thousands of simple binary commands that the CPU understands, software tell the CPU what to do, we can run multiple pieces of software all at once .

## The opearting system of the computer is the master program that manages how software get to use the hardware
