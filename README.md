# The Growth Mindset

**Growth mindset** believes that the abilities can be developed through effort, perseverance, learning and training, intelligence and talent are good starting 
points, on the other hand *fixed mindset* intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits and that there's no need for further development or effort which 
is wrong, we always need to improve and develop our abilities and skills . 

### In my opinion to keep yourself in a growth mindset you should : 
1. Accept new challenges and never give up when you face a problem and you should keep trying.
2. Make the effort to learn new things and to gan new skills . 
3. Never judge anything based on your mood and never let your mood affect your decisions .
