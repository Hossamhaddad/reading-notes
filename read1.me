Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web, you can control how to display the document formatting words (Bold, Italic) also adding images and creating lists and a lot more, we can say that markdown is a regular text with a few non alphabetic characters thrown in like * or # or _ .
GitHub Flavored Markdown
GitHub uses its own version of the markdown syntax that provides some useful features making it easier to work with content on GitHub, some of these features are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and pull requests, such as @ mentions, references to SHA-1 hashes, task lists .
We can use Markdown around GitHub in Gist's, comments in issues and pull requests and with files with the .md or .markdown extension , we can use @ plus the username to mention people and teams, also we can add emoji by typing :EMOJICODE: .
You can tell GitHub to ignore Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.
