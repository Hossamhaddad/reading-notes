# Script
## Script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a specific goal . 

## To write a script we need to state our goal first then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve them : 
1. ### Define the goal
2. ### Design the scripy
3. ### Code each step 

# Expressions 
## Expressions results in a single value, we have two types of expressions : 
1. ### Expressions that just assign a value to a vairable : var color='black';
2. ### Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value for : var area=2*3;

# Operators :
## The expressions rely on things called operators, they allow the programmer to create a single value from one or multiple values .

## Operators types : 
1. ### Assignment operators : assign a value to a variable color='black'
2. ### Comparison operators : compare two values and return True or False buy=3>5;
3. ### Arithmatic operators : area=2*3;
4. ### Logical operators : combine expressions and return T or F
5. ### String operators : combine two strings hello='hello' + 'world'; concatenation 

# Functions
## Functions let us group a series of statement together to perform a specific task, we can reuse the function if we need it in diffrent parts of the script . 

##First we call the function that we need (calling), then we give the function the parameters that the function needs, and the function will return a value to us . 

## To declare a function we need to give it a name and write it a statements needed to achieve the function task:
 function sayhello() {
     document.write('hello)
 }
## After declaring a function we can excute all of the statements in it with one line of code, this is known as calling the function. 

## Some function has parameters, some function has values are called arguments and they can be provided as values or as variables. 
## For examples : 
1. Arguments as values : getArea(3,5);
2. Arguments as variables : 
wallwidth=3; wallHeight=5; getArea(wallwidth,wallHeight)
