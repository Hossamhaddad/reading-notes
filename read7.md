# Comparsion Operators
## You can evaluate a situation by comparing two values, and the result will be a Boolean True or False.

## Comparison operator examples : 
1. == equal to 
2. != not equal to
3. === strict equal to (compare the values and the data type)
4. !== strict not equal
5. (>) greater than
6. (<) less than
7. (>=) greater than or  equal to 
8. (<=) less than or equal to


## Logical operator allow you to compare the result of more than one comparison operator .
For example ((5<2) && (2>=3))
## Logical operators examples : 
1. && logical AND: if both expressions evalute to true then the expression return trye, otherwie its false .
2. || logical or : if it either expresssions evaluates to true then the expresion returns true, if if both returns false then its false .
3. ! logical not : if it was false it returns true, if its true it would return false > 

# LOOPS
## Loops check a condition if it returns true the code will run, then the condition will be checked again if it still true the code will run, the code will keep running as long as its true when the condition returns false it will stop . 

## Loops Types : 
1. For 
2. While
3. Do While

## FOR LOOP EXAMPLE : 
 for(var i=0; i<10; i++){
     document.write('i') 
 }

var i=o its called initialization (counter)
i < 10 its called the condition
i++ update everytime the load has run it adds one to the counter > 

## While loop example 
While(condition)
{
    the code will run till the condition is true 
}
